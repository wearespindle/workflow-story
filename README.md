# Devhouse Spindle Fairytale

Once upon a time...
There were some nerds.

They loved to play video games. 
They like to make awesome stuff.

They decided to make an awesome VoIP platform.
So they tamed a python and unchained Django.
They also created a movie called Django unchained.
Next they set off on an epic journey.

With it, they travelled far and wide. In their journey, they found a tank engine created by Mr. X, called Thomas, which was powered by a unicorn. The unicorn was a real GG. With it, they were able to share the magic of Django with the world.
They set out to Iceland first, but not all seemed to go accordingly to plan. Thomas the dank engine was so dank that the ice immediately melted. Instead of continuing their journey through Iceland, the nerds had to go back. While returning, the nerd leading the pack swore they were going in the right direction, but alas, they ended up in the second layer of Hell. While fighting and sneaking their way through the volcanic landscape they stumbled upon a metropolis made of iron with a tower of gargantuan height in the middle, much bigger than what they had ever seen before. Little did the nerds know what would await them in the City of Dis.

Despite the obstacles and the challenges, these nerds where for sure no quitters!

...And they lived happily ever after. THE END.
