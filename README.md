# Devhouse Spindle Fairytale

Once upon a time...
There were some nerds.

They loved to play video games. 
They like to make awesome stuff.

They decided to make an awesome VoIP platform.
So they tamed a python and unchained Django.
They also created a movie called Django unchained.
Next they set off on an epic journey.

With it, they travelled far and wide. In their journey, they found a tank engine created by Mr. X, called Thomas, which was powered by a unicorn. The unicorn was a real GG. With it, they were able to share the magic of Django with the world.
They set out to Iceland first, but not all seemed to go accordingly to plan. Thomas the dank engine was so dank that the ice immediately melted. Instead of continuing their journey through Iceland, the nerds had to go back.

Despite the obstacles and the challenges, these nerds where for sure no quitters!

...And they lived happily ever after. THE END.
