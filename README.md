# Devhouse Spindle Fairytale

Once upon a time...
There were some nerds.

They decided to make an awesome VoIP platform.  
So they tamed a python and unchained Django  
and set off on an epic journey.

With it, they travelled far and wide. In their journey, they found a tank engine created by Mr. X, called Thomas, which was powered by a unicorn. The unicorn was a real GG. With it, they were able to share the magic of Django with the world.

...And they lived happily ever after. THE END.
